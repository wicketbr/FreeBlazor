The only change made to the editor is that the ckeditor.js file has been modified and the
style applied to the placeholder text (search for 'data-cke-editorplaceholder') has been
modified to change the "::before" style color from "#aaa" to "#333" to better work with
the themes used in this app, especially when the editor is flagged as required and the
content is missing, so the background has the pink missing-required style applied.
